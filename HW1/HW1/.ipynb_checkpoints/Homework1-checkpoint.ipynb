    "Recall that in digital cameras the red, blue, and green sensors are interlaced in a Bayer pattern. Your goal is to fill the missing values in each channel to obtain a full color image. For this homework, you will implement three different interpolation algorithms. The input to the algorithm is a single image *im*, an N x M array of numbers between 0.0 and 1.0. These are measurements in the format shown in Figure 2, i.e. the top left pixel *im(0, 0)* is red, *im(0, 1)* is green, *im(1, 0)* is also green and *im(1, 1)* refers to the blue channel. Your goal is to create a single color image from these measurements.\n",
