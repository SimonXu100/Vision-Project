### 5 Stereo Depth

#### Greedy Stereo Matching 
From the left and right image, calculate the disparity between each pixel using a greedy matching algorithm. You may assume that the stereo pairs are rectified, which means the camera pairs are only horizontally translated. In your PDF, be sure to include both the code and the visualization of the estimated disparity.

Distance Function: There are a variety of distance functions that you can use. For this problem, you can just use sum of squared differences between RGB patches.

### dynamic programming based stereo estimation algorithm:  Viterbi algorithm
implement a dynamic programming based stereo estimation algorithm that incorporates the spatial smoothness between adjacent disparities. For the local matching cost, you can use the same sum-of-squared-differences


### 6 Motion
