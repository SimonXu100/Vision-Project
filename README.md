# Vision-Project

### 1 Image Formation and Sensing

Color image demosaicing:


Implement the nearest neighbour, linear interpolation algorithm.
Then, implement a more advanced method such as the adaptive gradient-based algorithm



### 2  Image Denoising 

#### Image Denoising

Implement a mean filter
Implement a mean filter using a filter matrix.
Implement a Gaussian filter.


#### Edge Detection

Implement a delta filter, a Laplacian filter.

#### Hybrid Images 

Fourier transform.
Implement low and high pass filters and apply them to images.
Create a hybrid image using high-pass and low-pass fitlered images.
