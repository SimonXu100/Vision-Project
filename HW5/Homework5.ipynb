    "In this homework, you will implement an two-view stereo algorithm. Given two images from a stereo rig, you can estimate the 3D depth of the scene by first calculating the disparity between pixels, and use the camera intrinsics to triangulate the depth. This homework will focus only on estimating the disparity between pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will estimate two stereo algorithms, which are both worth 50 points. In the first stereo algorithm, you should implement a greedy matching approach. In the second stereo algorithm, you should implement a stereo algorithm that incorporates a prior of spatial smoothness, which you optimize with dynamic programming.\n",
